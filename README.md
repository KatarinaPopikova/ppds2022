**Assignment**  
Implement two threads, which will use a common index to a common array of the size (initialized to zero). Let each
thread increment the element of the array where the common index is pointing and then increment the index. If the index
is out of range, the thread terminates. After this action count, how many elements of the array have value 1. If not
every element has value 1, modify program. After threads termination find out the multiplicity of values in array 
(histogram).
